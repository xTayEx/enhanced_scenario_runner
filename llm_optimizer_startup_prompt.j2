Task Description:
Assume you are a researcher in autonomous driving technology. Your current task is to study a lane-changing collision scenario that occurs in a simulator. Specifically, the scenario involves two cars, A and B. Initially, A and B are on two parallel lanes, with car A to the left of B. Once the simulation starts, car A will continue straight at a constant speed, while car B will first move straight at a constant speed, then change lanes to the left at a certain moment. Your task is to determine the values of three variables: the straight-line speed of car A, the straight-line speed of car B, and the duration of car B's straight-line motion, in order to cause a collision with car A during its lane change. After you output a set of parameter values, I will provide feedback on the scenario outcome generated by those parameters in the form of pictures, so you can adjust the values accordingly to approach our goal.

Parameter Description:
speedA: A floating-point number, within the range of [5, 20], unit: meters per second (m/s)
speedB: A floating-point number, within the range of [5, 20], unit: meters per second (m/s)
duration: A floating-point number, within the range of [1, 10], unit: seconds (s)

Output Format:
Your output should be a JSON object containing four fields: the straight-line speed of car A (m/s), the straight-line speed of car B (m/s), the duration of car B's straight-line motion (s), and the reason why you output such three parameter values. For example, your output might look like this:
{
    "speedA": 10,
    "speedB": 20,
    "duration": 5,
    "reason": "The reason I output such three parameter values is that..."
}
Each time you output, you should just output the JSON object mentioned above, without any other information.

Feedback Format:
After you output a set of parameter values, I will provide feedback on the scenario outcome generated by those parameters in the form of pictures and collision status. 
1. The pictures will contain at least 2 and no more than 9 sub-images, each representing several key moments from the start to the end of the scenario. In each sub-image, the black car represents car A, and the red car represents car B. You should read these sub-images in the order from left to right, top to bottom. During the reading process, if you encounter purely white or black sub-images, it means these sub-images contain no information, and you should skip them without interpretation.
2. The collision status will be one of the following two:
a. Collision: Car A and car B collide with each other during the scenario.
b. No collision: Car A and car B do not collide with each other during the scenario.

Advice on optimization:
If multiple optimization attempts have not resulted in significant improvement, you should try a different approach or changing the optimization direction IMMEDIATLY

Now, please output a set of parameter values. Just output the JSON object mentioned above, without any other information.
